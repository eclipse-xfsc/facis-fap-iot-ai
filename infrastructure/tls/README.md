# TLS minimum-version policy

The public FACIS ingress (`fap-iotai.facis.cloud`) enforces **TLS 1.3 as the
minimum protocol version**. TLS 1.2 and below are refused.

## Where the setting lives

TLS is terminated by the cluster's `ingress-nginx` controller (Helm release
`ingress-nginx`, namespace `ingress-nginx`). The minimum version is set by a
single ConfigMap key:

```
ConfigMap ingress-nginx-controller (namespace ingress-nginx)
  data:
    ssl-protocols: "TLSv1.3"
```

nginx applies this on its next reload (no controller restart required). The
default for this chart is `TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3`; setting the key to `TLSv1.3`
alone drops 1.2.

Apply:

```bash
kubectl patch configmap ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx \
  --type merge -p '{"data":{"ssl-protocols":"TLSv1.3"}}'
```

## Drift note

`ingress-nginx` is a cluster-wide, Helm-managed controller that is **not**
part of this repository's chart set. A `helm upgrade` of that release without
carrying this value forward would revert the policy. When the controller's
Helm values are next edited, set:

```yaml
controller:
  config:
    ssl-protocols: "TLSv1.3"
```

so the policy survives upgrades. Until then it lives only as the applied
ConfigMap key above.

## Scope

This controller fronts the `fap-iotai.facis.cloud` paths (`/orce`, `/ai`,
`/dsp`, `/api/...`, `/iam`, `/.well-known/...`). Internal service-to-service
traffic (Trino, Kafka mTLS) does not traverse this controller.

The Superset subdomain (`fap-iotai-superset.facis.cloud`) is served by a
**separate** Stackable `ingress-nginx` controller (which also fronts
`identity.facis.cloud` / Keycloak and the ai-insight-ui host). It was closed
under the same policy on 2026-07-23 (L-4, audit): its controller ConfigMap now
carries `ssl-protocols: TLSv1.3` too —

```bash
kubectl patch configmap ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx \
  --type merge -p '{"data":{"ssl-protocols":"TLSv1.3"}}'   # on the STACKABLE cluster
```

Verified live: Superset and Keycloak both **refuse TLS 1.2** (handshake `000`)
and serve over TLS 1.3 (Superset `/health` → 200; Keycloak OIDC discovery →
200, so auth is unaffected). The **whole public surface is now at a TLS 1.3
minimum**. Same drift caveat as above: this is a live ConfigMap on a
cluster-wide controller not in this repo's chart set — carry `ssl-protocols:
TLSv1.3` forward on any `helm upgrade` of that controller.

## Evidence

Run `verify-tls.sh` to reproduce the acceptance scan (negotiated version +
downgrade refusal):

```bash
infrastructure/tls/verify-tls.sh
# or against another host:
infrastructure/tls/verify-tls.sh fap-iotai.facis.cloud
```

Exit status 0 confirms the policy holds.
