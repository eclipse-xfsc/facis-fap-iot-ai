# facis-dsp-connector Helm chart

Eclipse Dataspace Protocol connector for the FACIS FAP IoT & AI platform.

## What this chart renders

The DSP control plane is owned by an ORCE (Node-RED) runtime via the flows
under `services/dsp-connector/orce/flows/`. By default
(`dedicatedOrce.enabled=true`) the chart deploys its **own** single-replica
ORCE instance for that runtime, isolated from the shared ORCE pod (see
`docs/architecture/fap-role-mapping.md` §Deployment topology). Set
`dedicatedOrce.enabled=false` to fall back to deploying the flows onto the
shared ORCE pod instead.

Rendered only when `dedicatedOrce.enabled` (the default):

- `Deployment/<fullname>-orce` + `Service/<fullname>-orce` (port 1880) — the
  dedicated ORCE runtime. Three init containers: `init-data` seeds the runtime
  home from the image, `init-deps` installs the DSP flows' npm packages and
  applies the rdkafka mTLS SSL overlay, `init-settings` enables
  `functionExternalModules` (jose). Reuses this chart's `-dsp-secrets` Secret
  (`envFrom`), `-orce-datasets` ConfigMap, and `facis-dsp-state` PVC directly —
  no cross-chart wiring.
- `PersistentVolumeClaim/<fullname>-orce-data` — the runtime home
  (`/data`: settings.js, node_modules, flows). RWO; the Deployment uses
  `strategy.type: Recreate`.
- `Secret/<fullname>-orce-admin` (key `token`) — this instance's Admin API
  bearer token, from `dedicatedOrce.adminToken` (REQUIRED when enabled). The
  pod reads it as `ORCE_ADMIN_TOKEN`; the flow-deploy Job sends the same value
  as `Authorization: Bearer`.

Rendered in both modes:

- `ConfigMap/<fullname>-orce-flows` — bundles the flow JSON files from
  `files/orce-flows/`. Source of truth: `services/dsp-connector/orce/flows/`.
  Run `./sync-flows.sh` from this directory before `helm install/upgrade`.
- `ConfigMap/<fullname>-orce-datasets` — wraps `files/orce-config/datasets.json`
  for the ORCE pod to mount at `/data/dsp-config/datasets.json` (read-only
  catalogue source).
- `Secret/<fullname>-dsp-secrets` — DSP_HMAC_SECRET, DSP_DATA_API_BASE_URL,
  DSP_DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS, DSP_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP, DSP_TRINO_URL (external
  coordinator address — the Trino coordinator lives on a separate Stackable
  cluster whose internal DNS name does not resolve from the ORCE pod),
  SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS (`dsp.kafkaBrokers` — full broker list for the
  consumer-side ingest flow's `${SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS}` substitution), the NF-1
  identity values under `dsp.iam.*`, and — when `dsp.pg.enabled` — DSP_PG_PASSWORD
  + DSP_PG_URI (`postgresql://<user>:<password>@<fullname>-postgres:5432/<database>`)
  for the state store. Consumed by the ORCE pod via `envFrom`.
- `PersistentVolumeClaim/facis-dsp-state` — backs `/data/dsp-state/` on the
  ORCE pod for `transfers.json` + `negotiations.json`.
- `StatefulSet/<fullname>-mongo` + `Service/<fullname>-mongo` — self-contained
  MongoDB instance backing the Identity Hub (`credentials` collection of
  issued/self-issued VCs, see `facis-dsp-iam-hub.json`). Unlike the
  prerequisites below, this is entirely within this chart — no cross-chart
  wiring needed. Disable with `dsp.iam.mongo.enabled=false`.
- `StatefulSet/<fullname>-postgres` + `Service/<fullname>-postgres` (port 5432)
  — self-contained PostgreSQL instance backing DSP transfer/negotiation state
  (SRS §6.1). Single replica, PVC mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
  (`subPath: pgdata`), `pg_isready` readiness probe. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` comes
  from the `-dsp-secrets` Secret's `DSP_PG_PASSWORD` key; the state flow reaches
  it via `DSP_PG_URI`. Configured under `dsp.pg.*` — disable with
  `dsp.pg.enabled=false`.
- `NetworkPolicy/<fullname>-postgres` + `NetworkPolicy/<fullname>-mongo` (NF-8)
  — Calico-enforced, INGRESS-ONLY default-deny on the two datastores. Postgres
  (5432) and Mongo (27017) accept traffic ONLY from the dedicated ORCE pod
  (component `dsp-orce`); every other pod is denied. Egress is untouched, so
  ORCE's outbound Kafka/Trino/DID-fetch is unaffected. Rendered only when
  `dedicatedOrce.enabled` (in shared-pod mode the client's labels are outside
  this chart, so enabling them would cut the state path — they self-skip).
  Disable with `networkPolicies.enabled=false`. CAVEAT: because Calico enforces
  these, a selector that drifts from the datastore/ORCE pod labels would sever
  the live NF-5 state connection — keep them in sync.
- `Job/<fullname>-orce-flow-deploy` — post-install/upgrade hook. Polls the
  target ORCE Admin API until ready, fetches its live flow set, merges this
  chart's tabs into it by node id (never a full-replace — see the Job script's
  own comments), and POSTs the merged set back with
  `Node-RED-Deployment-Type: nodes`. Targets the dedicated instance's own
  Service + admin Secret when `dedicatedOrce.enabled`, else the shared pod via
  `orceFlowDeploy.orceAdminUrl` / `orceFlowDeploy.adminTokenSecret`.

For the dedicated-mode cutover from the shared pod, see the "Rollout: shared →
dedicated ORCE" runbook in
[`services/dsp-connector/orce/README.md`](../../orce/README.md).

## ORCE chart prerequisites (shared-pod mode only)

**Only applies when `dedicatedOrce.enabled=false`.** In the default dedicated
mode the chart's own ORCE Deployment already wires the secrets, ConfigMap, and
PVC below, so none of this cross-chart setup is needed. In shared-pod mode the
separate ORCE Helm chart must be configured to:

1. Reference the secrets and config rendered by this chart:
   ```yaml
   # In the ORCE chart values
   extraEnvFrom:
     - secretRef:
         name: facis-dsp-connector-dsp-secrets
   ```

2. Mount the state PVC and datasets ConfigMap:
   ```yaml
   extraVolumes:
     - name: dsp-state
       persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: facis-dsp-state
     - name: dsp-datasets
       configMap:
         name: facis-dsp-connector-orce-datasets
   extraVolumeMounts:
     - name: dsp-state
       mountPath: /data/dsp-state
     - name: dsp-datasets
       mountPath: /data/dsp-config
       readOnly: true
   ```

3. Reference the pre-created private-key Secret as `DSP_CONNECTOR_KEY` — this
   connector's own signing key for did:web + Participant VC self-issuance
   (see `services/dsp-connector/orce/flows/facis-dsp-iam-issuance.json`).
   The Secret's data key is `privateJwk`, not `DSP_CONNECTOR_KEY`, so this
   needs a single renamed env var rather than a bulk `extraEnvFrom` — the
   same shape this chart's own `orce-flow-deploy-job.yaml` already uses to
   rename its `token` key to `ORCE_ADMIN_TOKEN`:
   ```yaml
   # In the ORCE chart values
   extraEnv:
     - name: DSP_CONNECTOR_KEY
       valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: facis-dsp-connector-identity-key   # matches dsp.iam.keySecret
           key: privateJwk
   ```

   Like `facis-orce-admin` (see "ORCE Admin API token" below), this Secret
   is deliberately **not** rendered by this chart — pre-create it before
   `helm install`:
   ```sh
   kubectl create secret generic facis-dsp-connector-identity-key \
     --namespace facis \
     --from-literal=privateJwk='{"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","d":"...","x":"...","y":"...","alg":"ES256"}'
   ```

4. Stay at `replicas: 1`. The state files are NOT multi-replica safe.

## Deploy order

For the default dedicated mode, follow the "Rollout: shared → dedicated ORCE"
runbook in [`services/dsp-connector/orce/README.md`](../../orce/README.md)
(new environments skip its shared-pod teardown steps). The shared-pod deploy
order below applies only when `dedicatedOrce.enabled=false`:

```sh
# 1. Sync flows + datasets into the chart's files/ directory
cd services/dsp-connector/helm/facis-dsp-connector
./sync-flows.sh

# 2. Install/upgrade this chart — renders Secret, ConfigMaps, PVC.
#    Hook Job is queued but won't run until pod sees mounts (see step 3).
helm upgrade --install facis-dsp-connector . \
  --namespace facis \
  --set dsp.hmacSecret=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 3. Upgrade the ORCE chart with the envFrom + volume references above.
#    The ORCE pod restarts and picks up DSP_HMAC_SECRET + /data mounts.
helm upgrade orce <orce-chart-path> --reuse-values \
  -f orce-extra-dsp-values.yaml

# 4. Helm post-install Job pushes flows to the ORCE Admin API.
#    Watch with: kubectl logs -n facis job/<release>-facis-dsp-connector-orce-flow-deploy
```

## ORCE Admin API token

In the default dedicated mode the chart renders the admin-token Secret itself
(`<fullname>-orce-admin`) from `dedicatedOrce.adminToken` — generate it with
`openssl rand -hex 32` and pass it at install (`--set dedicatedOrce.adminToken=...`).
The dedicated ORCE pod reads it as `ORCE_ADMIN_TOKEN`; the flow-deploy Job
sends the same value as `Authorization: Bearer`.

Only in shared-pod mode (`dedicatedOrce.enabled=false`) is the manual
`facis-orce-admin` Secret used instead — create it once:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic facis-orce-admin \
  --namespace facis \
  --from-literal=token="<token issued by ORCE Admin API>"
```

## Endpoint paths

| Concern | Path |
|---------|------|
| Health  | `GET /api/v1/dsp/health` |
| Metrics | `GET /dsp/metrics` |
| Catalogue | `POST /dsp/catalogue/request` |
| Negotiations | `POST/GET /dsp/negotiations...` |
| Transfers | `POST/GET /dsp/transfers...` |

Namespaced under `/dsp` (rather than the bare `/api/v1/health` and
`/metrics` a standalone service would use) because the shared ORCE pod also
serves those bare paths for the Simulation flow — namespacing prevents route
collision.
