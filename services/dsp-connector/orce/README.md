# DSP Connector — ORCE Native Runtime

This directory contains the ORCE Node-RED flows that implement the DSP
connector's control plane. They run on the connector's **own dedicated ORCE
(Node-RED) instance**, deployed by the `facis-dsp-connector` Helm chart when
`dedicatedOrce.enabled` (the default) — isolated from the simulation/SFTP/AI-UI
flows that share the other ORCE pod (see
[`docs/architecture/fap-role-mapping.md`](../../../docs/architecture/fap-role-mapping.md)
§Deployment topology). Setting `dedicatedOrce.enabled=false` reverts to the
legacy shared-pod deploy, where these tabs are merged onto the shared ORCE pod.

## State storage

Transfer-process and negotiation state is persisted in **PostgreSQL**, reached
via `DSP_PG_URI`. The `facis-dsp-connector` chart renders a dedicated Postgres
StatefulSet when `dsp.pg.enabled` (see
[`helm/facis-dsp-connector/README.md`](../helm/facis-dsp-connector/README.md)).
The `facis-dsp-state` flow owns the store:

- **Bootstrap**: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for `dsp_transfers` and
  `dsp_negotiations` (`id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, `doc JSONB`) on every boot.
- **One-time migration**: when a table is empty it seeds from the legacy
  PVC file at `/data/dsp-state/transfers.json` / `negotiations.json` if one is
  present, so an upgrade from the old file-backed store carries its rows
  forward.
- **Runtime**: each map is loaded into Node-RED global context
  (`global.get('transfers')` / `global.get('negotiations')`, both
  global-scoped); every change is written back transactionally
  (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` on failure) as a snapshot to the table.
- **Boot retry**: a restore failure surfaces on the tab's catch node, which
  rate-limits a retry — covering Postgres still starting when this instance
  boots.

The catalogue is **derived** from the FACIS Data Sink's queryable store (the
Trino/Iceberg lakehouse — see [`docs/architecture/fap-role-mapping.md`](../../../docs/architecture/fap-role-mapping.md)).
The `dsp-cat-derive-fn` node lists live gold-layer tables in Trino and merges
them with `/data/dsp-config/datasets.json`, which serves as a rich metadata
**overlay** and as an offline **fallback**:

- overlay entry whose gold table is live → kept as-is (rich metadata wins);
- overlay entry whose table is not live → dropped;
- live gold table with no overlay entry → minimal auto-derived entry;
- `catalogueSource = 'lakehouse'` on success.

Availability over strictness: on any Trino failure the derivation never
empties an already-populated catalogue; if the catalogue is still empty it
falls back to the full overlay file (`catalogueSource = 'overlay-fallback'`).
The startup file-read seeds the catalogue within milliseconds at boot; the
derivation replaces it once Trino answers and re-runs every 10 minutes. The
overlay file is a read-only ConfigMap mount at `/data/dsp-config/datasets.json`.

**Single-replica only**: state now survives pod restart and reschedule — it
lives in Postgres, not in pod-local files. The `replicas: 1` constraint remains,
but it is a property of the Node-RED runtime, not of the state store: between
writes the authoritative copy of each map is the in-memory global context of a
single pod, with a single writer. Running ORCE with more than one replica would
require sharing that context across instances, which is out of scope for this
demonstrator.

**Durability drill (state survives a pod kill)** — reproduces the persistence
evidence; also serves as the rolling-update / pod-loss demonstration. With
`kubectl` pointed at the cluster running the dedicated ORCE instance:

```bash
# 1. Create a transfer (negotiate first; see the E2E scripts for the full
#    negotiate→transfer sequence), note its id, and confirm the row is in Postgres:
kubectl exec -n orce <postgres-pod> -- \
  psql -U dsp -d dsp_state -tAc "SELECT id, state FROM dsp_transfers"

# 2. Kill the ORCE pod:
kubectl delete pod -n orce -l app.kubernetes.io/component=dsp-orce

# 3. After it reschedules, the restore log line proves the state was reloaded:
kubectl logs -n orce -l app.kubernetes.io/component=dsp-orce -c orce \
  | grep "restored from PostgreSQL"
#   -> "DSP state: N transfer(s), M negotiation(s) restored from PostgreSQL"

# 4. The transfer is still served after the restart:
curl -sk https://fap-iotai.facis.cloud/dsp/transfers/<transferId>
#   -> the same transfer, same state
```

Note: a persist is fire-and-forget relative to the HTTP response, so a crash in
the sub-second window between a 200 and its `COMMIT` can lose the last mutation;
the durable record is the committed Postgres row.

## Endpoint paths

To avoid colliding with the Simulation flow's `/api/v1/health` and `/metrics`
on the shared ORCE pod, DSP endpoints are namespaced:

| Concern | Path |
|---------|------|
| Health  | `GET /api/v1/dsp/health` |
| Metrics | `GET /dsp/metrics`       |
| Catalogue | `POST /dsp/catalogue/request` |
| Transfers | `POST/GET /dsp/transfers...`  |
| Negotiations | `POST/GET /dsp/negotiations...` |

## Tests

```sh
cd services/dsp-connector/orce
npm install --include=dev
node --test tests/flows
```

Most specs re-implement each function-node body inline and exercise it under
`node:test`. **Invariant**: keep the spec helpers in sync with the function-node
`func` strings in the corresponding flow JSON — this convention has a known
weakness (a real flow-JSON edit can drift from its hand-copied spec without
any test failing) documented in `tests/harness/run-node.js`'s header.

`tests/flows/iam-revocation-harness.spec.js` uses a different pattern:
`tests/harness/run-node.js` executes a `type:"function"` node's `func`
string read directly from the flow JSON at test-run time, in a `vm`
sandbox built to match Node-RED's real function-node sandbox (same
restricted globals, same `libs` resolution against real npm packages).
There is no hand-copied mirror to drift — the test always exercises
whatever is actually committed. Scope, honestly: it runs one function node
in isolation per call (fixture `msg` in, captured `node.send()`/return
value out); it does not boot a real Node-RED runtime or walk `http
in`/`link call`/wire chains automatically. New flow logic with meaningful
branching is a good candidate for this pattern instead of a new
hand-mirrored spec file; porting the existing hand-mirrored specs is a
separate, larger follow-up, not done as part of adding this.

## Deploy

The chart's `sync-flows.sh` copies these files into
`helm/facis-dsp-connector/files/orce-flows/` (and `orce-config/`) before
`helm install/upgrade`. The post-install Job fetches the **target** ORCE
instance's live flow set (the dedicated instance by default, the shared pod
when `dedicatedOrce.enabled=false`), merges these tabs into it by node id, and
POSTs the merged set back to the ORCE Admin API at `${adminUrl}/flows` with
`Node-RED-Deployment-Type: nodes` — never a full-replace, which would wipe
every other tab already on the target instance.

See `helm/facis-dsp-connector/README.md` for the full deploy procedure and,
for the shared-pod fallback, the ORCE-chart prerequisites (envFrom secrets,
volume mounts). The one-time migration from shared pod to dedicated instance
is the "Rollout: shared → dedicated ORCE" runbook below.

## Rollout: shared → dedicated ORCE

This migrates the DSP flow set off the shared ORCE pod onto the connector's
own dedicated ORCE instance. It is a one-time cutover per environment; new
environments install straight into dedicated mode and skip the shared-pod
teardown (steps 6–7).

Prerequisites in the release namespace (the chart does **not** create these):

- `facis-kafka-certs` — Kafka mTLS client cert (`ca.crt`/`tls.crt`/`tls.key`).
- `facis-dsp-connector-identity-key` — this connector's signing JWK
  (key `privateJwk`), wired to the pod as `DSP_CONNECTOR_KEY`.
- `facis-orce-rdkafka-patch` ConfigMap (key `rdkafka-patch.js`) — the SSL
  overlay for `node-red-contrib-rdkafka`. Mounted `optional: true`; absence
  only logs a warning, but without it the Kafka data-plane cannot connect:
  ```sh
  kubectl create configmap facis-orce-rdkafka-patch -n <ns> \
    --from-file=rdkafka-patch.js=services/simulation/orce/rdkafka-patch.js
  ```

1. **Render + install the dedicated instance.** Sync flows, then install with
   the required secrets. `dedicatedOrce.adminToken` is this instance's own
   Admin API bearer token (the dedicated pod reads it from env; the flow-deploy
   Job sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`):
   ```sh
   cd services/dsp-connector/helm/facis-dsp-connector
   ./sync-flows.sh
   helm upgrade --install facis-dsp-connector . -n <ns> \
     --set dsp.hmacSecret=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
     --set dsp.trino.password=<live trino-users password> \
     --set dedicatedOrce.adminToken=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   ```
2. **Wait for the pod to become Ready.** First boot compiles librdkafka in the
   `init-deps` container (several minutes):
   ```sh
   kubectl rollout status deploy/facis-dsp-connector-orce -n <ns> --timeout=15m
   ```
3. **Wait for the flow-deploy Job to succeed.** The post-install hook polls the
   Admin API until it answers, then merges the DSP tabs onto the (empty) live
   set:
   ```sh
   kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job \
     -l app.kubernetes.io/component=orce-flow-deploy -n <ns> --timeout=10m
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=orce-flow-deploy -n <ns>
   ```
4. **Smoke-test through the dedicated Service** (port-forward avoids depending
   on Ingress at this point):
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc/facis-dsp-connector-orce -n <ns> 1880:1880 &
   curl -fsS http://localhost:1880/api/v1/dsp/health
   curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:1880/dsp/catalogue/request \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
   ```
5. **Apply the updated Ingress** so external DSP traffic reaches the dedicated
   Service (`facis-ingress.yaml` routes `/dsp`, `/api/v1/dsp`, `/iam`,
   `/api/data`, `/.well-known/did.json`,
   `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` to `facis-dsp-connector-orce`;
   `/api/v1` and the rest stay on the shared `orce` pod):
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/ingress/facis-ingress.yaml
   ```
6. **Remove the DSP tabs from the shared ORCE pod.** The DSP tab ids are:
   `tab-dsp-catalogue`, `tab-dsp-consumer`, `tab-dsp-data`, `tab-dsp-errors`,
   `tab-dsp-health`, `tab-dsp-iam-hub`, `tab-dsp-iam-issuance`,
   `tab-dsp-iam-verify`, `tab-dsp-negotiations`, `tab-dsp-state`,
   `tab-dsp-transfers`. Do **not** POST a filtered full set with
   `Node-RED-Deployment-Type: full` — full-replace on the shared pod would wipe
   the simulation/SFTP/AI-UI tabs. Two safe options:
   - **Editor (simplest, reviewable):** open the shared instance's Node-RED
     editor, delete each `FACIS DSP — …` tab, and Deploy. Visual and per-tab.
   - **Disable via a nodes-mode POST** (scriptable — flips each DSP tab to
     `"disabled": true` without touching any other tab; nodes mode diffs by id
     so only the posted tab nodes change):
     ```sh
     ORCE=http://facis-orce.orce.svc.cluster.local:1880   # shared pod
     TOKEN=<shared-orce admin token>                      # facis-orce-admin
     REV=$(curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Node-RED-API-Version: v2' \
       "$ORCE/flows" | jq -r '.rev')
     TABS='["tab-dsp-catalogue","tab-dsp-consumer","tab-dsp-data","tab-dsp-errors","tab-dsp-health","tab-dsp-iam-hub","tab-dsp-iam-issuance","tab-dsp-iam-verify","tab-dsp-negotiations","tab-dsp-state","tab-dsp-transfers"]'
     curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Node-RED-API-Version: v2' "$ORCE/flows" \
       | jq -c --argjson tabs "$TABS" --arg rev "$REV" \
         '{rev:$rev, flows: (.flows | map(if (.type=="tab" and (.id as $i | $tabs|index($i))) then .disabled=true else . end))}' \
       > /tmp/disable-dsp.json
     curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -H 'Node-RED-API-Version: v2' -H 'Node-RED-Deployment-Type: nodes' \
       -X POST "$ORCE/flows" --data @/tmp/disable-dsp.json
     ```
7. **Hand the `facis-dsp-state` PVC over to the dedicated pod.** It is
   `ReadWriteOnce`, so the shared pod must release it before the dedicated pod
   can bind it. On the shared ORCE Deployment it was mounted by an out-of-band
   patch; remove that volume + volumeMount, then let the shared pod restart:
   ```sh
   # VERIFY the live indices first — they are deployment-specific and the
   # placeholders below (N for the volumeMount, M for the volume) are NOT
   # authoritative:
   kubectl get deploy orce -n orce -o json \
     | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts | to_entries[] | select(.value.name=="dsp-state")'
   kubectl get deploy orce -n orce -o json \
     | jq '.spec.template.spec.volumes | to_entries[] | select(.value.name=="dsp-state")'
   # Then remove both at their real indices:
   kubectl patch deployment orce -n orce --type=json -p='[
     {"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/volumeMounts/N"},
     {"op":"remove","path":"/spec/template/spec/volumes/M"}
   ]'
   ```
   Only after the shared pod has fully terminated (`kubectl rollout status`)
   will the dedicated pod's `dsp-state` mount bind. If the dedicated pod is
   stuck `ContainerCreating` on `Multi-Attach`, the shared pod still holds the
   claim — confirm it is gone before proceeding.

   **Index verification is not optional:** removing the wrong array index
   silently detaches an unrelated volume from the shared pod. Re-list the
   indices immediately before patching every time.

## NF-2: Data Lake HTTP Ingest

`facis-dsp-data.json` (provider) serves real Trino-backed data at
`GET /api/data/:assetId`, replacing the `ai-insight-service` Python stub at
the same literal path. That Python route
(`services/ai-insight-service/src/api/rest/routes/dsp.py`'s `data_router`)
is left in place but is dead code: the live Ingress never routed
`/api/data` to it (only to the ORCE `Service`), and the `dataApiBaseUrl`
default it depended on (`ai-insight.facis.cloud`) has no DNS record or
Ingress rule either. Deleting the Python route/HMAC modules is a separate,
explicitly out-of-scope cleanup — `hmac_signing.py`/`hmac_middleware.py`
are also used by the still-live `POST /api/v1/dsp/create-pull-url` route,
which this plan does not touch.

`facis-dsp-consumer.json` (consumer) drives an already-negotiated transfer,
follows its access object, and lands the result in `bronze.dsp_ingest` via
a new `dsp.ingest.raw` Kafka topic (see
`infrastructure/lakehouse/setup_lakehouse.py` /
`setup_nifi.py`'s `--add-bronze-table` / `--add-topic` flags). It does not
drive contract negotiation itself. It DOES now attach a self-issued VP to
its own outbound calls to the provider: once per ingest run it link-calls
`iam.issue` (`dsp-iam-issue-fn` in `facis-dsp-iam-issuance.json`), which
mints a short-lived VP wrapping a self-issued Participant VC — both signed
with `DSP_CONNECTOR_KEY` under `DSP_CONNECTOR_DID`, using the same
`jose.SignJWT` pattern as the OID4VCI credential endpoint — and Bearer-sets
it on both internal hops (`POST /dsp/transfers`, `GET /dsp/transfers/:id`).
This lets the provider's own `iam.verify` accept the consumer's calls under
`DSP_IAM_ENFORCE=enforce`. Mint failure is non-fatal (logged via
`node.error`; the hops fall back to no auth, which still succeeds under
`warn`).

**Enforce-mode config prerequisite (self-issued VP)**: for the provider's
`iam.verify` to accept the connector's own self-issued VP, the connector's
DID (`dsp.iam.connectorDid` / `DSP_CONNECTOR_DID`,
`did:web:fap-iotai.facis.cloud` by default) MUST be present in
`DSP_TRUSTED_ISSUERS` (`dsp.iam.trustedIssuers`, empty by default). Without
this, the internal hops are rejected with `untrusted_issuer` under enforce.
The VP's `aud` is `DSP_VP_AUDIENCE` (also the connector's own DID by
default, so this is self-consistent out of the box once the DID is
trusted). The minted VC carries no `credentialStatus`, so no
BitstringStatusList endpoint is needed for these internal hops.

**Topic creation assumption**: `--add-topic` only provisions the NiFi
consumer flow for `dsp.ingest.raw`; nothing in this plan creates the Kafka
topic itself. As with the existing `sftp.ingest.raw` topic (the sibling
`sftp-ingestion-service`'s Bronze topic, also never explicitly provisioned
anywhere in this repo), `dsp.ingest.raw` is expected to auto-create on
first produce — if the live broker has `auto.create.topics.enable`
disabled (the production recommendation per
`services/simulation/docs/deployment/infrastructure-prerequisites.md`
§3.2, which the 9 `sim.*` topics follow but `sftp.ingest.raw` does not),
pre-create it manually before running `--add-topic`.

`provisionHttpPull()`'s signed URLs include a literal `+` in `expiresAt`
(e.g. `...123000+00:00`), unescaped in the query string. Verified against
this stack's actual Express version (4.22.1, pinned via the `qs`
dependency also present in `services/simulation/orce/node_modules`, which
Node-RED's `http in` node's underlying Express app uses for `req.query` in
its default `extended` mode): an unescaped `+` **does** decode to a space
by the time `dsp-data-verify-fn` reads it off `msg.req.query.expiresAt`
(confirmed with a real `express()` app hitting `req.query`, not just
`qs.parse()` in isolation — same `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
convention as Node's own `querystring`/`URLSearchParams`). `dsp-data-verify-fn`
now normalizes `expiresAt`/`from`/`to` back from space to `+` immediately
after reading `msg.req.query`, before HMAC reconstruction — see its
`unspacePlus()` helper. Remaining, narrower risk: a client that presents
the provider-issued pull URL to `GET /api/data/:assetId` via something
other than Node-RED/Express's own decoding (e.g. re-parses the URL through
a library that leaves a literal `+` alone, or double-decodes it) would
still see a signature mismatch — `tests/e2e/dsp-ingest-e2e.js` exercises
the real path end-to-end and will fail loudly (signature mismatch) if that
happens for the specific client/server pair it uses.

**Kafka broker config caveat**: the consumer flow's `rdkafka out` node
reuses `${SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS}`, an env var rendered by the *sibling*
`sftp-ingestion-service` Helm chart's Secret, not by this chart's own
`orce-secret.yaml`. Whether that var is actually visible inside the
dsp-connector's flows at runtime depends on the shared `orce` chart's
Deployment `envFrom` list (tracked outside this repo, per the existing
comment convention in `orce-secret.yaml`). Step 3 of the checklist below
verifies it's present before the E2E script runs — if `SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS`
is missing, add a `secretRef` for it to the `orce` Deployment's `envFrom`
list — otherwise the E2E script fails confusingly at the Kafka-produce step
with no obvious cause.

### Live deploy checklist (requires live cluster access — not automated)

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=k8s/K8s-cluster-IONOS-cloud.yaml

# 1. Provision Bronze + NiFi (additive, does not touch the 9 live sim flows)
#    Run from the repo root. The Python deps come from the simulation package:
#    pip install -e "services/simulation[lakehouse]"
python infrastructure/lakehouse/setup_lakehouse.py --env-file services/simulation/.env.cluster --add-bronze-table dsp.ingest.raw
python infrastructure/lakehouse/setup_nifi.py --env-file services/simulation/.env.cluster --add-topic dsp.ingest.raw

# 2. Apply the updated Ingress
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/ingress/facis-ingress.yaml

# 3. Verify SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS / DSP_INGEST_TOPIC are visible to the ORCE pod
#    (see the caveat above — add the envFrom entry if missing before continuing)
kubectl exec -n orce deploy/orce -- env | grep -E 'SFTP_KAFKA_BROKERS|DSP_INGEST_TOPIC'

# 4. Upgrade the dsp-connector Helm release (deploys the two new flow tabs
#    via the existing atomic POST /flows merge-by-id job)
cd services/dsp-connector/helm/facis-dsp-connector
helm upgrade facis-dsp-connector . -n orce \
  --set dsp.trino.password=<the live trino-users password>

# 5. Run the live E2E script
cd ../../orce/tests
node e2e/dsp-ingest-e2e.js --env-file .env.cluster
```

## NF-3: Kafka Data-Plane Provisioning (FR-DP-002)

`facis-dsp-transfers.json`'s kafka-streaming path is real: `dsp-tx-create`
builds an honest access object (real stable bootstrap, sanitized single-`tp-`
topic name, `sasl: null`, an explicit `accessNote`) and routes to the new
`dsp-tx-kafka-admin` function node, which creates the topic via `node-rdkafka`'s
`AdminClient` over the connector's own mTLS certs (`/etc/kafka-certs/`) before
the 202 response is sent. `dsp-tx-terminate` deletes the topic (fire-and-forget
via the same node); `dsp-tx-suspend` deliberately does not — it is a reversible
pause. `node-rdkafka` is already on the pod as `node-red-contrib-rdkafka`'s
dependency (see `infrastructure/orce/init-deps-patch.yaml`); no init-deps change
is needed.

What's real: topic creation/deletion on the live broker, the bootstrap address,
the FSM hooks, the no-credential access object. Known limitations, stated
honestly:

- **No per-topic authorization.** The cluster has no ACL authorizer and is
  mTLS-only; any certificate the Stackable CA trusts can read any topic.
  Enabling SASL/SCRAM or ACLs is cluster-side infrastructure requiring
  client/PMO sign-off — a documented decision-gate item, not built here.
- **No credential delivery, by design.** Delivering this connector's own key
  would allow full impersonation across every topic it touches (including
  internal SFTP/DSP-consumer production traffic). Counterparty mTLS trust is
  arranged out-of-band with the data space operator.
- **Suspend is state-only** at the data plane (nothing to revoke in-band).
- **`expiresAt` is advisory** — no reaper deletes expired topics; terminate is
  the cleanup path.
- **A provisioning failure that occurs after the broker already committed the
  topic is recoverable** — the resulting `ERROR`-state transfer keeps its
  `access.topic`, and `ERROR`→`TERMINATED` is now a legal transition, so a
  `terminate` on it deletes the orphaned topic (previously this was a dead end:
  the topic existed on the broker with no recorded name and no cleanup path).
- **Kafka-streaming transfers stay `STARTED`** (never `COMPLETED`) so
  suspend/terminate remain reachable; `facis_dsp_transfer_completions_total`
  counts successful provisioning for this format.
- `dsp-tx-kafka-admin` itself is not unit-testable (native `node-rdkafka` +
  live broker); the pure logic around it is harness-tested
  (`kafka-access-harness.spec.js`, `kafka-terminate-harness.spec.js`) and the
  AdminClient behavior is verified by `tests/e2e/dsp-kafka-transfer-e2e.js`.

### Live verification (requires live cluster access — not automated)

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=k8s/K8s-cluster-IONOS-cloud.yaml

# 1. Deploy the updated flows + the fixed DSP_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP default
cd services/dsp-connector/helm/facis-dsp-connector
helm upgrade facis-dsp-connector . -n orce \
  --set dsp.trino.password=<the live trino-users password>

# 2. Confirm the pod sees the new bootstrap and has node-rdkafka
kubectl exec -n orce deploy/orce -- env | grep DSP_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP
kubectl exec -n orce deploy/orce -- ls /data/node_modules/node-rdkafka/lib/admin.js

# 3. Put the mTLS PEMs where the E2E script expects them (extract from
#    Secret/facis-kafka-certs or your credential store) and run it
mkdir -p /tmp/facis-kafka-certs   # ca.crt, tls.crt, tls.key
cd ../../orce/tests
node e2e/dsp-kafka-transfer-e2e.js --env-file .env.cluster
```

## Rate limiting (data plane)

`GET /api/data/:assetId` enforces a per-agreement sliding window (default
10 requests/minute, `DSP_RATE_LIMIT__REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`;
`DSP_RATE_LIMIT__ENABLED=false` to disable) returning `429` with a
`Retry-After` header. The limiter key is the HMAC-bound `agreementId`, so it
cannot be spoofed independently of the signed URL.

Semantics, stated plainly (NF-12): this is an **in-memory sliding window in
Node-RED global context**, not a Redis token bucket. It is per-process — the
window resets on pod restart and would multiply across replicas — which is
bounded in practice by the single-replica ORCE runtime recorded in deviation
D-2 (`docs/deviation-register.md`). Any externalized (e.g. Redis-backed)
limiter is a follow-up tied to scaling that runtime out.
