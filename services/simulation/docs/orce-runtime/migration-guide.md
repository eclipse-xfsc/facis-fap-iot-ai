# Migration Guide — Python Simulation → ORCE-native Runtime

## Audience

Operators upgrading an existing FACIS deployment from the Python simulation
service to the ORCE-native runtime introduced on the
`feature/orce-native-simulation-runtime` branch.

## What changes

- Simulation lifecycle, tick generation, deterministic RNG, all 9 simulators,
  correlation engine, and the four protocol adapters (Kafka, MQTT, Modbus,
  REST) move into ORCE flows on the existing ORCE pod.
- The Python image is no longer the runtime; it remains in the chart as the
  rollback fallback (`compatibilityMode=legacy`) but is scaled to 0 by default.
- Helm chart adds a post-install Job hook that POSTs flow JSON to the ORCE
  Admin API.

## What does **not** change

- REST endpoint paths and JSON schemas (`/api/v1/simulation/*`,
  `/api/v1/{meters,pv,weather,prices,loads}`, `/api/v1/health`).
- Kafka topic names (`sim.smart_energy.*`, `sim.smart_city.*`) and the JSON
  payload field names + types.
- MQTT topic conventions, QoS, retain flags.
- Modbus TCP register addresses (Janitza UMG 96RM layout).
- The Stackable Kafka, NiFi, Trino, and MinIO/S3 backends.

## Controlled break: numeric determinism

The ORCE-native engine uses a JS-native `seedrandom('alea')` PRNG seeded via
`sha256(base_seed:entity_id:tag:ts_ms)`. The Python service uses numpy's
PCG64. The seeding strategy is identical, but the underlying bit-stream
algorithms differ.

**Concrete consequence**: BDD scenarios and integration tests that asserted
exact numeric values from the Python service will not match the ORCE-native
output. They have been rewritten to assert ranges, correlations and
reproducibility instead. Property-based tests in
`services/simulation/orce/tests/flows/*.spec.js` cover the new engine.

If a test of yours asserts a specific float, regenerate the baseline:

```bash
helm upgrade facis-simulation . --set compatibilityMode=orce
# Run your suite against the ORCE-native runtime; capture new baselines.
```

## Step-by-step rollout

### 1. Pre-checks

```bash
# Confirm Stackable Kafka certs are in place
kubectl -n facis get secret kafka-tls-certs

# Confirm ORCE admin token Secret exists
kubectl -n facis get secret facis-orce-admin

# Sync flow JSON into the chart files/ directory
cd services/simulation/helm/facis-simulation
./sync-flows.sh
```

### 2. Stage in a non-prod cluster

```bash
helm upgrade --install facis-simulation . \
  --namespace facis-staging --create-namespace \
  --set compatibilityMode=orce
```

Run the smoke tests in
[`operations-runbook.md`](./operations-runbook.md#verify-kafka-publishing).
Confirm at least:

- Engine boots and `/api/v1/simulation/start` transitions the FSM.
- Kafka `sim.smart_energy.meter` receives messages every `(60 / speed_factor)`
  seconds.
- Modbus client reads of register 19000-19001 round-trip to a non-zero float.
- Trino sees rows in `bronze.energy_meter` after a few minutes.

### 3. Production cutover

```bash
helm upgrade facis-simulation services/simulation/helm/facis-simulation/ \
  --namespace facis --reuse-values \
  --set compatibilityMode=orce
```

Watch:

- `kubectl -n facis logs job/facis-simulation-orce-flow-deploy` (post-install
  Job)
- `kubectl -n facis get pods` — Python deployment should scale to 0.
- ORCE pod logs for `[entrypoint] simulation runtime modules ready`.

### 4. Decommission the Python image (optional, deferred to Phase 16)

Once the ORCE-native runtime has run cleanly in production for one full week
including a Bronze→Silver→Gold cycle, you may delete:

- The Python `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, and the `src/` directory
  (after archiving).
- The `legacy` branch of the `compatibilityMode` flag.

The legacy path is intentionally retained until that point so rollback is a
single Helm value flip.

## Rollback

See [`rollback.md`](./rollback.md). One-line summary:

```bash
helm upgrade facis-simulation . --reuse-values --set compatibilityMode=legacy
```
